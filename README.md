# Detect-Battery-Status

Detect Battery Status is a simple web-based application that displays the current battery percentage and charging status of a user’s device. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the JavaScript Battery Status API to fetch real-time battery information.

The application visually represents the battery level using an animated battery bar and dynamically updates the percentage as the battery level changes. It also detects whether the device is charging or discharging and displays the corresponding status or remaining discharge time when supported by the browser.

To ensure better reliability, the project includes validation to handle browsers or devices that do not support the Battery Status API, preventing incorrect values such as NaN. This project demonstrates practical usage of JavaScript APIs, DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design.
